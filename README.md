# Hash-Table
C++ project using Hash Table data structure

There are three files, including two .cpp files and one .h file. I included many comments that explain what each line of code does and how the different functions collaborate together. 

I feel that learning the Hash Table was a bit complicated, however it is a necessary data structure to know as a software engineer/programmer.
